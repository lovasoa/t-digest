# Test and answer data generation with R

## large-uniform

Uniform distribution of 100,000 records generated by **r/large-uniform.r**

```
r < r/large-uniform.r --no-save
```

## small-uniform

Uniform distribution of 50 records generated by **r/small-uniform.r**

```
r < r/small-uniform.r --no-save
```

## large-normal

Normal distribution of 100,000 records generated by **r/large-normal.r**

```
r < r/large-normal.r --no-save
```

## small-normal

Normal distribution of 50 records generated by **r/small-normal.r**

```
r < r/small-normal.r --no-save
```

## large-skew

Skewed distribution of 100,000 records generated by **r/large-skew.r**

```
r < r/large-skew.r --no-save
```

## small skew

Skewed distribution of 50 records generated by **r/small-skew.r**

```
r < r/small-skew.r --no-save
```

## mass-point-left

Data set 1 with a large occurrence of the same value followed by the remaining distribution all to the other side of that value generated by** r/mass-point-left.r **

```
r < r/mass-point-left.r --no-save
```

## mass-point-right

Data set 2 with a large occurrence of the same value followed by the remaining distribution all to the other side of that value generated by** r/mass-point-right.r **

```
r < r/mass-point-right.r --no-save
```
